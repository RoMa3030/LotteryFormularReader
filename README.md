# Download Programm for using the tool
To use the tool only the installer .zip has to be downloaded.

When having the tool installed it's required to go to **Settings** and define the path to the "python.exe" file on your setup.
Also the paths to the pyhton scripts can be defined, but this should be correct by default.

.net 8 must be installed on the PC.
There will be no output if not all the required Python libraries are already installed on the PC.
